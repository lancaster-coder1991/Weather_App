# Weather_App

A simple app to display the weather in your current location - either hour, day or week.

The application has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as information from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The app has been deployed on Netlify. To take a look, head [here](https://georgesweatherapp.netlify.app/), or clone this repo to a local direction and open the index.html file in a browser.
