# Weather_App

A simple app to display the weather in your current location - either hour, day or week.

The application is being built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as information from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

This project is a work in progress and more information will be added here when it is complete. Watch this space!
